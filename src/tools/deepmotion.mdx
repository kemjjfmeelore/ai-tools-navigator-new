DeepMotion is an innovative AI animation platform that democratizes 3D character animation. It allows users to generate realistic 3D character movements from standard 2D video footage, eliminating the need for expensive motion capture suits and specialized equipment.

## Key Features

*   **AI Motion Capture:** Converts regular video of human movement into 3D motion data for characters.
*   **Realistic Character Animation:** Applies generated motion data to 3D character models, producing lifelike animations.
*   **Full-Body Tracking:** Capable of tracking full-body movements from a single video source.
*   **Facial Capture:** Can also capture facial expressions to enhance character realism.
*   **Accessible 3D Animation:** Lowers the barrier for creating complex 3D animations for games, film, and virtual reality.
