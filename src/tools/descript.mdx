Descript is a groundbreaking audio and video editor that challenges traditional workflows. Its core philosophy is to enable editing media "like a Word document." It automatically transcribes your audio and video, allowing you to cut or modify media clips by simply editing the corresponding text, dramatically increasing editing efficiency.

## Key Features

*   **Text-Based Editing:** Directly cut, copy, and paste sections of transcribed text to edit your audio and video.
*   **Studio Sound:** Achieve studio-quality sound with a single click, eliminating background noise and echo from your recordings.
*   **Overdub (Voice Cloning):** Capable of cloning your own voice. If you make a mistake while recording, you can simply correct the text, and the AI will generate the correct audio in your cloned voice.
*   **Automatic Filler Word Removal:** Automatically detects and removes "um," "uh," and other common filler words or verbal tics from your recordings.
