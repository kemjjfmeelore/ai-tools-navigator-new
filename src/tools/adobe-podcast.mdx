Adobe Podcast is a suite of AI-powered audio tools launched by Adobe, designed to help creators easily enhance audio quality. Its core "Enhance Speech" feature is highly acclaimed for its powerful effectiveness and free availability.

## Key Features

*   **Enhance Speech (Core Function):** Users simply upload an audio file, and the AI automatically removes background noise and room echo, making recordings sound as if they were professionally recorded in a studio.
*   **Mic Check:** Before recording, the AI can analyze your microphone setup and provide recommendations for optimization to ensure the best possible sound quality.
*   **Online Recording and Editing:** Offers a simple online recording studio that supports multi-person remote recording and basic text-based editing.
